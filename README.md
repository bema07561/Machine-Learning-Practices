## Fundamentals of Machine Learning Projects  
**Beijing Institute of Technology**  

This repository contains machine learning projects developed as part of the **Fundamentals of Machine Learning** course at Beijing Institute of Technology. The projects demonstrate core concepts and techniques in machine learning, including neural networks, classification, clustering, and probabilistic models.  

### Projects  

#### 1. **Training Neural Networks with the Iris Dataset**  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Description:**  
  Implemented gradient descent from scratch to train a neural network on the Iris dataset. This project demonstrates how to develop and optimize neural network models without relying on external libraries.  

#### 2. **SVM Classification on Iris and Moon Datasets**  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn  
- **Description:**  
  Utilized Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification tasks on the Iris and Moon datasets. The results were visualized to analyze the decision boundaries and classification performance.  

#### 3. **Hidden Markov Model (HMM) â€“ Forward Algorithm**  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Description:**  
  Implemented the Forward algorithm to compute sequence probabilities in Hidden Markov Models (HMM). This project focuses on probabilistic models and their practical implementation.  

#### 4. **Clustering with Moon Dataset**  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Description:**  
  Implemented K-means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms. The results were visualized to highlight the clustering behavior and algorithmic differences when applied to the Moon dataset.
